////userAgent
//provides information that identifies the web browser
//read-only
window.navigator.userAgent;

//useful when offering functionality depending on the web broser
//there's no guarantee that the browser agent is indeed the one advertised by this property.
//Some browsers allow users to modify useragent to pretend they are using another browser
//therefore, you can't rely on detecting user browser this way
if (window.navigator.userAgent.includes("Chrome")){

} else {
    // addEventListener is not supported, use another way
}

////cookieEnabled
//returns true if cookies are enabled
//read-only

//returns a geolocation object to interact with Geolocation API
//see geoLocation.js

//language
//returns user's browser language

//returns an object to read and write to system clipboard interacting with clipboard API

//returns an object that can be used to query and update permission status of APIs covered by the Permissions API. 
//we'll talk about it in a later unit
